## Follow up Questions

**If given more time, how would you improve the quality of your application?**

_Im pretty happy with the quality, but if I had more time I may take a look at the sorting of data and make sure it was as efficient as possible as with extremely large sets of data it may not be as quick as it could be_

**Would you implement anything differently?**

_Just better separation of concerns. Add a CompanyList, and CompanyCard Component instead of having all of it in one single Community Component._
